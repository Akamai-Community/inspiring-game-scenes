# Tips for Using the Models



This document walks you through how to use our template model to create your own voxel art - and we’ll give you some tips along the way. The default model that you can [download here ](https://github.com/Akamai-Community/inspiring-game-scenes/tree/main/models/desktop-template)is quite bare. When you open up the file, you’ll see a 3-D model old computer built into a monitor with relatively nothing inside. If you’re new to voxel art, we recommend downloading [Magicavoxel](https://www.voxelmade.com/magicavoxel/) to get started.

## 1. Make use of the space

The first thing to consider when working on your game-inspired scene is to make full use of the space in the template. 
In the template, there’s the confined space within the monitor, but you can also go outside of it and utilize the space around the keyboard and mouse.

As you can see above, the external walls are quite flat, so you can do whatever you want with them. 

<!--1.2 --><img src="https://github.com/Akamai-Community/inspiring-game-scenes/blob/main/assets/img/getting-started-imgs/gettingstarted_tip1.2.png" width="700">

You can add pipes, ladders, roads, etc. In the image above, you can see that I’ve added a ladder on the side of the monitor that links to the flooring, connecting the main piece with the center of the computer.

## 2. Take it apart and make it your own

You can use the template as you see fit. Break it and split it off as much as you like.

As you can see above, there is a big chunk on the top left that I’ve moved up and forward. You can customize this frame as much as you’d like to compliment your scene. 

<!--2.2 --><img src="https://github.com/Akamai-Community/inspiring-game-scenes/blob/main/assets/img/getting-started-imgs/gettingstarted_tip2.2.png" width="700">

I adjusted the frame to make space for my little scene of a dragon burning a bush. To effectively make use of the model, it sometimes means you have to break it apart.

## 3. Consider the composition

You can choose different angles and composition styles. When I save an image, I often choose an angle that features the character in the center. I also consider the light sources around it. 
There’s no limit to your options here. 
Your story can be told by spilling the scenery outside of the template. In the image below, you can see that I put this slime on the keyboard. What matters most is that you express something that you love about the game you’re referencing.

## 4. Use only what you want

The main piece of our template is the desktop monitor. You don't have to use it. You can get rid of it, but I’ve kept it in our files so you can choose to use it. Any component can be hidden or deleted. 
<!--4.1 --><img src="https://github.com/Akamai-Community/inspiring-game-scenes/blob/main/assets/img/getting-started-imgs/gettingstarted_tip4.1.png" width="700">

You're gonna notice that I've actually done that in this piece here, where I started breaking in these pieces. These te animals exist in the back. Uh, the backing of the desktop, you can keep, you can go harder into it and do it in elements like that. Just make full use of it. Incorporate the reference into the desktop.

## 5. Just have fun!

The purpose of this challenge is just to have fun and build your own little game within a desktop. We’re excited to see what you create. I’d love to see a story being told. If it's an adventure game, maybe the character venturing into the desktop or trying to escape the desktop. 
Have fun with this and share what you create with the templates and examples we’ve provided!
