# Welcome to Akamai’s Inspiring Game Scenes Repo

This repo contains files and examples to help you build game-inspired voxel art. 

------



*Close your eyes and think back to your childhood. Can you remember the games you loved to play after a long day at school? We wanted to make it easy for you to bring some of those childhood memories back to life (or at least to 3D), so we created this repo.* 

At Akamai, we deliver content for some of the world's biggest game companies, influencing millions of players' lives daily. We love gaming on our team and have always been inspired by the new ideas, stories, and tech that comes from games. And we know that a lot of you feel the same way. 

We commissioned [Zach Soares](https://twitter.com/Voxels), a voxel art teacher and designer, to create a set of game-themed templates and building blocks. In this repo, you’ll find voxel templates, example artwork, and some tips from Zach to help you get started. 

Our developer community constantly inspires us by sharing interesting, funny, and useful projects. So, in the hopes of giving back, we’ll be adding new building blocks and examples to this repo to inspire artwork that brings back that familiar nostalgia of early games. 

If you create something awesome that you’d like to share, send it over to us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akamaidev)!

## Modifying the Voxel Models

This GitHub repo contains all the files you need to build your own retro game-inspired voxel art. **We’ll be providing the template and adding new examples each week that you can use as building blocks or inspiration. All you need to do is star and follow this repo to get updates as we release new scenes.**

1. Star and follow this repo to get notified when we release new scenes that you can use to build your own artwork, or just for inspiration. 
2. Download the template file [here](https://github.com/Akamai-Community/inspiring-game-scenes/tree/main/models/desktop-template)(models folder in this repo) and open it in your favorite voxel editor. If you’re new to voxel art, we suggest using [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/), a free voxel editor, but there are other great options out there.
3. Model your retro game-inspired scene inside of the monitor. You can use the area inside of the monitor or expand outside of its borders. Try to take advantage of the 3D space. Need inspiration? We wrote out some [tips to use the models.](https://github.com/Akamai-Community/inspiring-game-scenes/tree/main/models#readme)
4. Export a rendering of your scene and share it on Twitter using the following hashtags so we can see what you’ve created and share with our community: @akamaidev #inspiringgamescenes 

Want some tips on how to get the most from these files? Zach Soares put together a [tips to using the models guide.](https://github.com/Akamai-Community/inspiring-game-scenes/tree/main/models#readme)

We partnered with [MagicaVoxel, a free open-source voxel editor,](https://ephtracy.github.io/) to help us ramp up for an upcoming game jam that we’re huge fans of: [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/). 

Ludum Dare brings gamers, developers, and artists together to create a game over one weekend. It’s all about exploring new game concepts, putting your twist on game art and animations, and inspiring others with your creativity. 

In honor of Ludum Dare 51, we are hosting our own voxel game art contest. We invite you to build and share retro game-inspired scenes using our desktop template (pictured above) and examples that we’ll be adding each week from Zach Soares. Below, you’ll find the rules for a chance to win a Razer laptop, gaming chair, monitor, and more. 

Star and follow our repo to stay up to date on new downloadable voxel art each week. We’ll be adding new building blocks and examples for you to utilize. 

We can’t wait to see what you create!
